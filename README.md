Project Title: Quick Numbers - Design and produce an Android app game that let improve the mathematical skills for children.

For my project I have decided to make a simple game in Java for children (age 4 – 10 years old).

Aims:
– Design an Android game for children, age 4 – 10 years old
– Implement the game for an Android Jelly Bean	4.1.X and higher
– Testing application
– Evaluate the game

Objectives:
– Investigate existing maths games on the market
– Identify good design practice for children
– Create user accounts management system
– Develop a fully working application with multiple levels that get progressively harder and are randomly generated mathematical basic calculations to solve
– Testing application in order to detect errors
– Usability testing
